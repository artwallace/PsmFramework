Rendering
* Implement Image as a trial run of drawable using shared shader.
* Consider adding a 2nd rendering pass. The first pass will only create ShaderObjects and the 2nd pass will consolidate 
  all similar, contiguous ShaderObjects into VBO arrays and send them in bulk to GPU. this would allow removing 
  of SpriteGroups, etc to make Update more flexible and render more efficient.
* (probably not) Redo debug label so that it only exists in debuglayer and let other objects add to it for effecient rendering like a spritegroup.
* (maybe) Consolidate debug layers into one?

Shaders
* Move OpenGL code from drawables to shader classes.

Drawables
* Fix DrawableBase.Changed. It's completely borked.
* fix drawablebase bounds
* Add foreground and background color support to DebugLabel.

Cameras
* Add world camera rotate at point
* fix world zoom after a certain level sprites flip.
* Check why de2d & ge2d show logo 1 pix differently. Probably zero based bug in de2d.
